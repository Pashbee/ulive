## ULIVE ##
jojotesting
The System Resource Display Tool with makeup.

The current version is just a jQuery function embeded into a flask layout template. The jQuery function runs every 2 seconds to pull JSON information from a dummy url. This dummy url is being routed by flask and is a simple GET page with a retruend JSON object.

Eventually there will be more configuration options, better features, no SetInterval (I hope) and more cross compatability. If you can present JSON information about your systems resources then ULIVE can do the rest.
